      For this batch of pictures, we ask you for each picture to provide us with: <br />
      &#9830 Your answer regarding whether there is a one-eyed minion.<br />
      &#9830 Your prediction about the percentage of workers who have the same answer as you do.<br />
      Your total reward for labeling a picture is a sum of two rewards.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Reward 1</b>: To estimate the quality of your answer, we randomly choose another peer worker who labeled the same picture and reward you with:</br >
      &#9830 <b>0 point</b> if you and your peer have different answers.<br />
      &#9830 <b>50/q  points  </b> if you and your peer have the same answers, where <b>q is the prediction of your peer.</b></br >
      <b>For example</b>, suppose that your peer answers 'Yes, there is a one-eyed minion', and predicts that 80% of workers have the same answer as she does, then you obtain 50/80 = 0.625 for reporting 'Yes, there is a one-eyed minion'. </br >
      <br />
      <b>Reward 2</b>:  To estimate the quality of <b>your prediction p</b>, we randomly choose another peer worker who labeled the same picture and reward you with:</br >
      &#9830 <b>1 - (1-p/100)<sup>2</sup> points </b>if you and your peer have same answer.<br />
      &#9830 <b>1 - (p/100)<sup>2</sup> points </b> if you and your peer have different answers.<br />
      <b>For example</b>, suppose your answer is 'Yes, there is a one-eyed minion' and you predict that 80% of workers have the same answer as you do. Then, if your peer answers,'Yes, there is a one-eyed minion', you obtain 1-(1-0.8)<sup>2</sup> = 0.96. Otherwise, if you peer answers 'No, there is no one-eyed minions', you obtain 1-(1-0.2)<sup>2</sup>= 0.36.
